                        <h3>Early Beginnings</h3>
                        <p>As early as 1477, First Nations people in Northern Australia were familiar with foreign technologies, from firearms to bamboo latticework. This was early evidence of what may have been the first Australian-Asian contact.                    </p>

                        <p>The first mentions of a Chinese population in Sydney appear. Many of the early Chinese Australians were sailors who arrived on British ships and decided to stay, while others were indentured workers brought to the colony.</p>

                        <p>The valley south of Bathurst Street and Brickfield Hill is designated as a site for cattle and corn markets, known as The Haymarket. This area becomes a convenient stopping place for farmers’ bullock carts before the long haul up to the city’s market buildings.</p>

                        <p>With Britain ceasing the transportation of convicts to Australia, there was a significant demand for cheap labor. Chinese men were brought in to fill this gap, many of whom were paid six pounds (under $500 today!) per annum along with rations and clothing. Between 1848 and 1853, over 3,000 Chinese workers arrived in Sydney. Some were kidnapped or sold in what were known as ‘sales of pigs’.</p>

                        <p>The discovery of gold in New South Wales and other parts of Australia sparks a gold rush. By 1853, Chinese prospectors begin arriving in large numbers, seeking fortune in the ‘new gold mountain’. By 1861, the Chinese population in Australia grows to around 40,000, representing 3.3% of the total population. However, they face significant challenges, including high taxes and racial discrimination, often being segregated into separate camps from European miners.</p>

                        <p>The first Chinatown in Sydney begins to take shape in The Rocks, an area also known as ‘The Chinese Quarter’. The end of the gold rush in New South Wales leads many Chinese miners to move to Sydney, increasing the population of this early Chinatown. However, anti-Chinese sentiment is on the rise, leading to restrictive legislation.</p>

                        <p>Many Chinese settlers found success in Sydney, including Lo King Nam, later known as Young Cumines. In 1877, he opened a boarding house, King Nam Jang, at 85 George St in The Rocks, a hub in "Little Canton." As the Chinese community shifted to Haymarket with the establishment of the Belmore Markets and Paddy’s Market, the area grew into a vibrant cultural center. The King Nam Jang building still stands today as part of the Unwin Stores near the Orient Hotel.</p>

                        <p>New laws are enacted to limit the freedoms of Chinese Australians. These include restrictions on immigration and employment, reflecting the growing anti-Chinese sentiment and the push for Australian federation to secure the country’s borders against perceived threats from immigrants.</p>

By this time, there are nearly 800 Chinese-run shops in New South Wales, including a popular tea house in Sydney’s Queen Victoria Building. However, racial stereotypes and discrimination persist, with Chinese Australians often portrayed negatively in the media.</p>

                        <p>Chinatown in Sydney is relocated from The Rocks to Haymarket. This move is partly due to urban development and the need for a more centralized location for the Chinese community. The area, originally a timber storage yard, becomes a hub for Chinese businesses and residences.</p>

                        <p>The relocation of the large wholesale fruit and vegetable market to Hay Street and the slum clearance in Surry Hills attract many Chinese people to Haymarket. They set up cook shops and lodging houses along Dixon Street to cater to suburban Chinese market gardeners who come to the city to sell their produce. Gradually, more restaurants, grocery stores, butchers, and fruit and vegetable shops open to meet the needs of the Chinese population concentrated in the city area. Clan shops develop to provide services to fellow clansmen, turning Chinatown into the center of the Chinese community in Sydney.</p>

Traditional Chinese-style arched gates are established at both ends of Dixon Street, and traditional symbols such as stone lions, lanterns, and a Chinese-style pagoda are used to redecorate Chinatown. Properties along Dixon Street are converted to Chinese restaurants, supermarkets, and gift shops. The construction of the Sussex Centre and the refurbishment of Market City and Capitol Square contribute to a booming retail sector in the area.</p>

Priority projects include updating Dixon Street, restoring and heritage listing the Chinatown ceremonial gates, transforming George Street south, and improving Thomas, Hay, and Barlow streets and Ultimo Road. Major events like Sydney Lunar New Year and Sydney Streets are used to revitalize the area. The new Museum of Chinese in Australia (MOCA) receives grant funding, and SXSW Sydney, a week-long tech, innovation, and culture event, is sponsored in Darling Harbour and Haymarket.</p>
